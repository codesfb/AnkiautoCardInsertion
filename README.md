# How to run the program?

"This app helps me study languages; right now, I’m studying Spanish! :)

I was sick and tired of manually adding cards to Anki one by one. Now, I just write a text file and Anki Automator does the rest. It adds audio and creates both the front and back of the cards.

It even adds an image to the card, though that part isn't perfect yet—sorry! I intend to make it better over time, making it more versatile and adding a better GUI."

It's a project to make studying smarter, not harder.




``` bash


# If you haven't already, install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv


# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate


# Run the program
python gui.py
